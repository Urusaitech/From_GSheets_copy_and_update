This script takes data from [the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f-qZEX1k_3nj5cahOzntYAnvO4ignbyesVO7yuBdv_g/edit#gid=0), then saves it to the [new sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f-qZEX1k_3nj5cahOzntYAnvO4ignbyesVO7yuBdv_g/edit#gid=0) and addes a new column to it.

How to run:
- download main.py and sacc1.json
- put them in a single repository 
- run main.py

Might be issues running the script on network hardware since the script uses local system files to store price rate.
